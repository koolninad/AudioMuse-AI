# Core test/runtime packages for running the analysis unit test locally.
# Install these in your virtualenv. We intentionally exclude system-level
# components (ffmpeg, voyager index DB, etc.) which should be stubbed.
# IMPORTANT: Versions aligned with Dockerfile where possible
# NOTE: onnx version differs - Dockerfile uses 1.14.1 (Python 3.10/Ubuntu 22.04)
#       but we need >=1.16.0 for Python 3.12+ pre-built wheels

numpy==1.26.4
librosa==0.11.0
scipy==1.15.3
numba==0.60.0
soundfile==0.13.1

onnx>=1.16.0               # Newer version needed for Python 3.12 compatibility

# Notes:
# - ffmpeg (system binary) is NOT included here — keep pydub/ffmpeg calls stubbed or
#   install ffmpeg separately on your machine if you want full fallback behavior.
# - voyager is a system-level vector index; tests should keep a small stub rather
#   than installing production Voyager binaries.
